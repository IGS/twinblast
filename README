TwinBLAST - View 2 BLAST reports at once
----------------------------------------

TwinBLAST is a web-based tool for viewing 2 BLAST reports simultaneously
side-by-side. It uses ExtJS (www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) to provide 2
independently scrollable panels. BioPerl (www.bioperl.org) is used to index
raw BLAST reports and Bio::Graphics is used to draw pictograms of the BLAST
hits.
